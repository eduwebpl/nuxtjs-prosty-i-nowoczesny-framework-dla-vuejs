    <p>Janusz Korczak, the pen name of Henryk Goldszmit (22 July 1878 or 1879 – 7 August 1942), was a
      Polish Jewish educator, children's author and pedagogue known as Pan Doktor ("Mr. Doctor") or Stary
      Doktor ("Old Doctor"). After spending many years working as a principal of an orphanage in Warsaw, he
      refused sanctuary repeatedly and stayed with his orphans when the entire population of the institution
      was sent from the Ghetto to the Treblinka extermination camp by the Nazis, during the Grossaktion
      Warschau of 1942.</p>

            `Korczak was born in Warsaw in 1878. He was unsure of his birth date, which he attributed to his
    father's
    failure to promptly acquire a birth certificate for him. His parents were Józef Goldszmit, a
    respected lawyer from a family of proponents of the haskalah, and Cecylia née Gębicka, daughter
    of a
    prominent Kalisz family. Born to a Jewish family, he was an agnostic in his later life who did
    not
    believe in forcing religion on children. His father fell ill around 1890 and was admitted
    to a
    mental hospital, where he died six years later on 25 April 1896. Spacious apartments were
    given
    up on Miodowa street, then Świętojerska. As his family's financial situation worsened, Henryk,
    while
    still attending the gymnasium (the current 8th Lycée in Warsaw began to work as a tutor for
    other
    pupils. In 1896 he debuted on the literary scene with a satirical text on raising children,
    Węzeł
    gordyjski (The Gordian Knot).`,
            `In 1898, he used Janusz Korczak as a pen name in the Ignacy Jan Paderewski Literary Contest. The
    name
    originated from the book Janasz Korczak and the Pretty Swordsweeperlady (O Janaszu Korczaku i
    pięknej
    Miecznikównie) by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski. In the 1890s he studied in the Flying University.
    During
    the years 1898–1904 Korczak studied medicine at the University of Warsaw and also wrote for
    several
    Polish language newspapers. After graduation, he became a pediatrician. In 1905−1912 Korczak worked
    at
    Bersohns and Baumans Children's Hospital in Warsaw. During the Russo-Japanese War, in 1905–06 he
    served
    as a military doctor. Meanwhile, his book Child of the Drawing Room (Dziecko salonu) gained him some
    literary recognition.`,
            `Korczak's orphanage is still in operation at 6 Jaktorowska Street
    In 1907–08, Korczak went to study in Berlin. While working for the Orphans' Society in 1909, he met
    Stefania Wilczyńska, his future closest associate. In 1911–1912, he became a director of Dom Sierot
    in
    Warsaw, an orphanage of his own design for Jewish children. He hired Wilczyńska as his
    assistant.
    There he formed a kind-of-a-republic for children with its own small parliament, court, and a
    newspaper.
    He reduced his other duties as a doctor. Some of his descriptions of the summer camp for Jewish
    children
    in this period and subsequently, were later published in his Fragmenty Utworów and have been
    translated
    into English.`,
            `During World War I, in 1914 Korczak became a military doctor with the rank of lieutenant. He served
    again as a military doctor in the Polish Army with the rank of major during the Polish-Soviet War,
    but
    after a brief stint in Łódź was assigned to Warsaw. After the wars, he continued his practice in
    Warsaw.`
